## BAYES Esports Front-end Coding Challenge

###### Build
To build, run the `build` script by typing the command 
```
npm run build
```
###### Frameworks
Bootstrap 4, React.js 16. Bootstrap 4 requires jQuery and Popper JS to work.

Webpack is the bundler used while Babel is used for enabling ES6+ support.

###### Tournaments List & Tournament Details
I decided to use an in-place details view to present the Tournament Details for two reasons:

1. I find this more user friendly as the user does not have to navigate away from the list to see the details. 

2. Also, the user is able to compare details of different tournaments while still on the same Tournament List page.

###### Browser Compatibility
IE is not really supported as I didn't use any polyfills for this. The app should work well with all modern browsers. It was tested with Chrome.
